        <p>As our agency has grown, the Founders (myself, Michael and Elliot) have had less time to connect directly with everyone like we could in the early days. Back then, the first team members had unhampered access to our vision, energy, and insights, which, due to scale, isn't the case anymore. So to help bridge that gap we've put together this guide to share the key lessons and principles that we believe have underpinned our success. We want to share it with you, the people we think have what it takes to lead our business in future.</p>
<p>This website is designed to help you quickly understand our values, approach, and broadly speaking, how we tackle challenges... "How we do things round here". So if you've been asked to read it, take it as a compliment, and take the time to digest it properly. If you do, you'll be better equipped to thrive hereâ€¦ and ensure we keep building something amazing.</p>
