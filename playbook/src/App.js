        <p>As our agency has grown, the Founders (myself, Michael and Elliot) have had less time to connect directly with everyone like we could in the early days. Back then, the first team members had unhampered access to our vision, energy, and insights, which, due to scale, isn't the case anymore. So to help bridge that gap we've put together this guide to share the key lessons and principles that we believe have underpinned our success. We want to share it with you, the people we think have what it takes to lead our business in future.</p>
<p>This website is designed to help you quickly understand our values, approach, and broadly speaking, how we tackle challenges... "How we do things round here". So if you've been asked to read it, take it as a compliment, and take the time to digest it properly. If you do, you'll be better equipped to thrive hereâ€¦ and ensure we keep building something amazing.</p>

        <p>Open Partners launched in 2017, and you'll hopefully know the story about our growth? In case you don't, we're officially one of the top 100 fastest growing companies in the UK (Sunday Times), and unofficially the fastest growing Independent media agency in the UK (Google). </p>
        <p>We now have over 50 clients, 140 staff, more than Â£70m annual turnover, and offices in Manchester, London, Liverpool, Bristol, Toronto, and Melbourne. What we're doing isn't normal and our rise has been meteoric, growing more than 50% every year since we launched in 2017. So from that perspective we're special. I wanted to start this memo by sharing what we think the reasons are for that.</p>

        <p>In 2017 we started off as a Media Agency, but we're not that anymore. We adapted, and now call ourselves the 'Agency of Next'. As the Agency of Next we deliver Marketing Transformations. We came to our brand positioning after asking our clients why they chose to work with us. Consistently they told us that it was because they trusted us more than anyone else, felt that the best place to be was by our side, and it was our ability to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing market that genuinely set us apart from the rest. Many of our clients have followed us from our previous agency and are still with us today, in many cases trusting in us for more than 15 years. There's something very special about the capabilities we have built and the way we combine them together. Our vision as Founders was that marketing success today is now digital-first and underpinned by Media that's optimised for attention, Creative that's specialist and 'fit-for-platform', and Data that's of the highest quality, enabling us to target audiences more accurately and measure performance more precisely. Over the past 7 years we have built the agency to have specialist expertise in each of these three 'Disciplines' - Media, Creative and Data - and by integrating them all under one roof we have created a one-stop-shop for clients making it smarter, faster and better to just use us.</p>
